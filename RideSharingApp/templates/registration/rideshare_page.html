            <h2>Ride Status Viewing</h2>
            <p>A ride owner or sharer should be able to view the
                status of their non-complete rides. For open ride requests, this should show the current ride
                details (from the original request + any updates due to sharers joining the ride). For confirmed
                ride requests, the driver and vehicle details should also be shown.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h2>Ride Searching</h2>
            <p>A driver should be able to search for open ride requests. Only requests
                which fit within the driverâ€™s vehicle capacity and match the vehicle type and special request info
                (if either of those were specified in the ride request) should be shown. A driver can claim and
                start a ride service, thus confirming it. Once closed, the ride owner and each sharer should be
                nofied by email that the ride has been confirmed (hence no further changes are allowed).
                
            </p>
